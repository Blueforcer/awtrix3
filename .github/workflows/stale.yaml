            There hasn't been any activity on this issue recently. So we have to clean some
            of the old issues.

            Please make sure to update to the latest AWTRIX version and
            check if that solves the issue. Let us know if that works for you by
            adding a comment 👍

            This issue has now been marked as stale and will be closed if no
            further activity occurs. Thank you for your contributions.
